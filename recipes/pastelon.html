            <h2>Pastelon - a Puerto Rican Plantain Lasagna</h2>
            <p><strong>Layers of thinly-sliced plantains, ground beef, and cheese, all in one cozy casserole.</strong></p>
            <p>Pastelón, the Puerto Rican layered meat and sweet plantain pie, is one of those recipes that can divide families.</p>

                <p>Being a <em>“Nuyorican”</em> (a Puerto Rican from New York), I found this to be true when my husband and I came together over our first dish of pastelón. As a native Puerto Rican, he argued that my version “wasn not the real deal.”</p>
                
                <p>It was as real to me as his attitude, so I defended my version tooth and nail!</p>

                    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned on the outside and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove meat from pan; drain fat.</li>
                            <li>Place tomato sauce, sofrito, green olives, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, recao, and oregano in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Return ground beef to skillet; reduce to a simmer. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes more.</li>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8- or 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.</li>
                            <li>Pour oil into a large skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry plantain slices until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
                            <li>Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; add 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                            <li>Line the bottom of the baking pan with half the plantains, overlapping as needed. Layer ground beef mixture, green beans, and remaining plantains; pour eggs on top. Top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
                            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                            
                        </ol>
